  "notes": "\n[2025-12-30 07:33:19]\nBitcoin needs to go from ~$95k to $1M in 12 months - that's over 10x gain. Even in the most extreme bull scenarios with dollar collapse narratives, the most optimistic voices are discussing $500k-$1M as extreme tail scenarios, not baseline expectations. Market pricing at 0.1% seems accurate.\n\n[2025-12-30 08:30:21]\nCritical insight: The market resolution window is ONLY December 30-31, 2025. We are already IN that window (current date is Dec 30, 2025). Bitcoin is at ~$105k. To reach $1M, it would need to move 850%+ in the next 1-2 days. The largest single-day gain in Bitcoin history was 42%. Even if Bitcoin had TWO consecutive days of its largest-ever gains (42% each), it would only reach ~$213k, nowhere near $1M. This is mathematically impossible given historical volatility constraints.\n",
  "facts": [
    "Bitcoin is currently trading around $90,000-95,000 USD as of December 30, 2024",
    "Prediction markets show median expectations for Bitcoin above $150,000 by year-end 2025, with long-tail bets on hyper-growth scenarios",
    "Some platforms show less than 10% chance of Bitcoin exceeding $1 million in 2025 according to the search results",
    "Bitcoin's price on December 30, 2024 was approximately $94,500 USD according to historical data",
    "Bitcoin's historical ATH was ~$73,000 in March 2024, meaning it would need to increase by ~1,270% from that peak to reach $1M",
    "Bitcoin reaching $1M would require a market cap of ~$20-21 trillion (assuming 21M total supply), which would exceed gold's current market cap of $14-15 trillion",
    "Bitcoin's largest verified single-day gain was around +42% on December 16, 2013. Even the most extreme historical single-day moves have been under 50%"

    "Twitter sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish with predictions of breaking $100k, but this is far from the $1M target",

    "The market resolution window is extremely narrow - only December 30-31, 2025. With Bitcoin at ~$105k on Dec 30, it would need an unprecedented 850%+ single-day move to reach $1M"
