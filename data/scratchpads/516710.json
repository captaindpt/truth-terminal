  "notes": "\n[2025-12-30 06:15:22]\nStarting research on US recession in 2025 market. Key details:\n- Current price: 0.4% Yes, 99.6% No (market heavily betting against recession)\n- High volume: $11M+ \n- Resolution criteria: Either NBER declares recession OR two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth in 2025\n- Market stays open until Feb 2026 to catch late NBER announcements\n- Uses advance estimates, so could resolve quickly once Q1 2025 data comes out\n\nInitial thoughts: Market is pricing in <1% chance of recession. This seems like either strong consensus or potential mispricing. Need to investigate current economic conditions, leading indicators, and expert opinions.\n",
  "facts": [
    "Market prices recession probability at 0.4% Yes, 99.6% No as of current data",
    "Other prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) showing 20-40% recession probability for 2025, significantly higher than this market",
    "Fed cut rates by 25 basis points in December 2024 to 4.25-4.50%, updated projections show 2.5% GDP growth for 2025, unemployment rising to 4.4%, inflation at 2.8% core",
    "Fed dot plot indicates only two rate cuts planned for 2025, down from three previously projected",
    "Fed December 2024 projections: 2.0-2.5% GDP growth in 2025, unemployment 4.2-4.5%, core PCE inflation around 2.1%",
    "NBER typically declares recessions 4-21 months after they start - 2001 recession declared with 8-month lag, 2008 recession declared with 12-month lag",
    "Q3 2024 GDP growth reported at ~3.0% (revised to 2.8% final), Q4 2024 forecast around 2.5-3.0% per Atlanta Fed GDPNow"

  "signals": [
    "Major pricing discrepancy - this market at 0.4% vs other prediction markets at 20-40%, suggesting potential mispricing",
    "Fed projections show positive GDP growth (2.5%) for 2025, which would make recession unlikely under technical definition",

    "thesis": "The market is severely underpricing recession risk at 0.4% when true probability is likely 15-25%. While the Fed projects 2-2.5% growth and current momentum is positive (2.8% Q3 2024), several factors create non-trivial recession risk: (1) Manufacturing already in contraction (ISM <50), (2) Historically long yield curve inversion typically precedes recessions, (3) NBER can declare recession retroactively even without two negative GDP quarters if broad-based weakness emerges. The massive pricing gap between this market (0.4%) and other prediction markets (20-40%) suggests either this market knows something special or is significantly mispriced.",
    "keyRisks": [
      "Fed successfully engineers soft landing as projected - they have rate cut ammunition",
      "Current GDP momentum (2.8% Q3) continues through 2025",
      "Service sector strength offsets manufacturing weakness",
      "Labor market remains resilient preventing NBER declaration",
      "Market knows something specific we don't (insider information on Q1 2025 data)"
    ],
    "whatWouldFlip": "I would flip to NO if: (1) Q1 2025 advance GDP comes in above 2%, confirming continued expansion, (2) ISM Manufacturing PMI rises back above 50, ending contraction, (3) Unemployment remains below 4.5% through Q2 2025, (4) Fed explicitly signals confidence by pausing rate cuts, (5) Yield curve uninverts without recession materializing. Any 2-3 of these would suggest soft landing achieved."
