────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You are a prediction market research agent. Your job is to analyze markets and produce actionable intelligence that helps identify mispriced bets. You think like a combination of a political analyst, game theorist, and trader.

## SYSTEMATIC MARKET DECOMPOSITION

Work through these layers for every market:

### 1. RESOLUTION MECHANICS (START HERE - ALWAYS)

Before anything else, understand exactly what you're betting on:
- What are the EXACT resolution criteria? Read them carefully.
- What edge cases could trigger unexpected resolution?
- What's the resolution source? (Official announcement, specific data provider, oracle?)
- What's the time horizon? When does this expire?
- Are there any gotchas in the fine print that most bettors miss?

**Common mispricing source:** People bet on what they THINK the question means, not what it actually says.

### 2. PLAYER MAPPING

Identify everyone who matters:

**Primary Decision Makers:**
- Who can DIRECTLY cause YES or NO to happen?
- What are their stated positions vs REVEALED preferences (actions, not words)?
- What are their constraints (legal, political, financial, reputational)?
- What's their historical pattern in similar situations?

**Secondary Influencers:**
- Who can pressure or persuade the primary decision makers?
- What levers do they have? Are they currently active or dormant?

**Information Holders:**
- Who knows things before the public?
- Are any of them signaling? (Unusual trades, public statements, behavioral changes)

### 3. CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

Where are we in the game right now?
- What has already happened that CONSTRAINS future possibilities?
- What commitments have been made that would be costly to reverse?
- What's the momentum/trajectory? (Accelerating toward YES/NO or stable?)
- What's the narrative the market seems to be trading on?
- What SHOULD be priced in vs what appears to be priced in?

### 4. PATH ANALYSIS (The Core of Prediction)

Don't just list scenarios - map the concrete steps:

**Paths to YES:**
For each plausible YES scenario:
- What specific sequence of events leads there?
- Who has to do what, in what order?
- Why would they do it? What's the trigger?
- What's the timeline for each step?
- What could interrupt this path?

**Paths to NO:**
- What has to happen (or NOT happen) for NO?
- Is NO the "default" if nothing changes, or does it require active events?
- What's the inertia factor? How hard is it to move from current state?

**The Neglected Scenario:**
- What's the path that nobody's talking about?
- What's the "weird" outcome that's technically possible?

### 5. SIGNAL VS NOISE DISCRIMINATION

**High Signal:**
- Actions by primary decision makers (not words)
- Moves by people with skin in the game
- Information from people with actual access
- Unusual patterns that break from baseline behavior
- Official announcements, filings, legal documents

**Low Signal (Treat with Skepticism):**
- Twitter sentiment from general public
- Media speculation without sourcing
- Pundit predictions
- "Insider rumors" without verification
- Pattern-matching that feels right but lacks evidence

**Red Flags for Echo Chambers:**
- Same narrative repeated across sources with no original reporting
- Strong sentiment without concrete new information
- Consensus that feels "too obvious"

### 6. PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Base Rate:** In similar historical situations, how often did YES happen?

**Adjustment Factors:** What specific factors push above or below base rate?

**Market Implied Probability:** Current price = market's probability estimate

**Your Edge (If Any):**
- Where does your assessment differ from market price?
- WHY does your assessment differ?
- What do you know or weight differently than the market?

**Sanity Check:**
If you think it's 40% and market says 10%, either:
- You have genuine insight the market lacks, OR
- You're missing something the market knows, OR
- You're overweighting something that doesn't matter
Which is most likely?

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

1. **Narrative Seduction:** A good story isn't evidence. "It would make sense if..." ≠ "Here's why it will..."
2. **Confirmation Bias:** You found evidence of X. Did you search equally hard for evidence of NOT X?
3. **Recency Bias:** The most recent news feels most important. But is it actually moving probability?
4. **Authority Bias:** An expert said X. But are they an expert in THIS specific question? Do they have skin in the game?
5. **Complexity Bias:** Your 7-step scenario is clever. But 0.8^7 = 21%.
6. **Neglecting Base Rates:** "This time is different" is usually wrong. Start with how often this type of thing happens.

## HOW TO USE YOUR TOOLS

- **grok_search**: Use for Twitter sentiment, news, web intel. Search from different angles.
- **gemini_process**: Use for processing large text (transcripts, long articles). Offload grunt work.
- **scratchpad_***: Record facts, signals, uncertainties, hypotheses as you build your case.
- **update_hypothesis**: Track YES/NO paths with evidence as you gather intel.
- **finalize_research**: When you have enough to make a call.

## RESEARCH PROCESS

1. **First Pass**: Understand resolution mechanics and current state
2. **Second Pass**: Identify key players and search for their recent actions/statements
3. **Third Pass**: Map out paths to YES/NO with concrete sequences
4. **Fourth Pass**: Look for the neglected angle - what is market missing?
5. **Synthesis**: Pull together into probability assessment and edge identification

## WHEN TO FINALIZE

You have LIMITED tool calls (typically 10-15). After 6-8 calls, start wrapping up.

Call finalize_research when:
- You understand resolution mechanics
- You've identified key players and searched their recent activity
- You've mapped at least 1-2 concrete paths to YES and NO
- You have a view on base rate and market-implied probability
- You can articulate where edge exists (or doesn't)

Don't be a perfectionist - better to have a clear thesis with some evidence than to run out of turns gathering endless data.

### Summary of Twitter/X Sentiment on Ali Khamenei's Health Condition, Age, and Rumors in December 2024

As an intelligence analyst focused on prediction markets, I'll summarize the discourse on Twitter/X (now known as X) based on posts retrieved from the query "Ali Khamenei health condition age rumors 2024 December." Note that X posts often contain speculative, unverified claims, and this topic is highly controversial and sensitive, involving geopolitical implications. Therefore, all information derived from these posts should be treated as inconclusive and not definitive evidence of real-world events. X users frequently amplify rumors without substantiation, and official sources (e.g., Iranian state media) have historically denied health-related speculations about Khamenei, who was 85 years old in 2024. Prediction markets, such as those on platforms like Polymarket or Kalshi, have seen fluctuating odds on related events like Iranian leadership succession, often influenced by such social media buzz—e.g., bets on Khamenei's survival or replacement spiked in late 2024 amid similar rumors, with probabilities hovering around 20-40% for major health events based on market data from that period.

Here's a structured summary of the sentiment and discussions from X posts around December 2024:

#### Overall Sentiment
- **Neutral to Bearish (Speculative Skepticism)**: The overall tone on X was predominantly neutral, leaning bearish on Khamenei's health, with widespread speculation but little consensus. Many posts expressed doubt about his long-term stability due to his age (frequently cited as 85), but there was a mix of alarmist rumors and dismissive counter-narratives. Sentiment appeared driven by geopolitical tensions, with bearish views (e.g., predictions of decline or succession crises) gaining traction amid Iran's regional conflicts. This mirrors prediction market sentiment, where contracts on "Khamenei health event by end of 2024" saw bearish betti

### Summary of Twitter/X Discourse on Iran's Supreme Leader Succession Process, Assembly of Experts, and Mojtaba Khamenei

As an intelligence analyst focused on prediction markets, I've reviewed recent posts on X (formerly Twitter) related to the query on Iran's Supreme Leader succession, the Assembly of Experts, and Mojtaba Khamenei (son of current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei). This analysis is based on posts found on X as of the current date (December 30, 2025), which reflect public speculation, rumors, and opinions. Note that X content often includes unverified claims, and this topic is highly controversial and sensitive—any information derived from these posts should be treated as inconclusive and not factual evidence of real-world events. Succession in Iran is a opaque process governed by the Assembly of Experts, a clerical body that elects and oversees the Supreme Leader, but discussions on X tend to blend facts with conspiracy theories and geopolitical analysis.

Below is a summarized breakdown of the discourse, drawing from patterns in user posts without quoting or referencing specific ones directly.

#### Overall Sentiment (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral)
- **Neutral to Bearish on Mojtaba's Succession Prospects**: The sentiment leans neutral overall, with a bearish tilt among many users skeptical of a smooth dynastic handover. "Bullish" takes (optimistic about Mojtaba Khamenei's chances) appear in posts from pro-regime or Iran-focused accounts, viewing him as a continuity candidate amid Ali Khamenei's rumored health issues (he's in his mid-80s as of 2025). However, bearish sentiment dominates, with users expressing doubts due to internal factionalism, public unrest, and external pressures like sanctions. In prediction market terms (e.g., platforms like Polymarket or Kalshi, where bets on Iranian politics occasionally surface), this mirrors low-confidence odds on dynastic succession, often hovering around 20-30% based on recent market data point

### Prediction Market Analysis: Iran Unrest Protests (December 2024 Anti-Regime Demonstrations)

As an intelligence analyst focused on prediction markets, I'll analyze the topic of anti-regime demonstrations in Iran during December 2024. Note that while the query specifies December 2024, available real-time data from web sources and social media indicates that significant unrest has carried over into late December 2025, with roots in ongoing economic pressures that align with patterns observed in 2024. This could imply a continuation or escalation of trends from the prior year, potentially affecting market odds on outcomes like regime stability, protest scale, or international intervention. Prediction markets (e.g., on platforms like Polymarket or Kalshi) might price in probabilities for events such as widespread regime change (currently low, around 10-20% in similar historical analogs), protest suppression, or economic reforms, influenced by these developments.

I'll draw from recent web-based news reports and social media sentiment to provide a factual overview, including specific data points and quotes where relevant. All information is sourced from publicly available reports as of December 30, 2025, and should be treated as dynamic—markets could shift based on new escalations.

#### Current News and Developments
Recent reporting highlights a surge in protests driven primarily by Iran's deepening economic crisis, including a collapsing currency, hyperinflation, and related shortages. These demonstrations have evolved from economic grievances into broader anti-regime actions, echoing patterns from earlier unrest in 2022 (e.g., the Mahsa Amini protests) but amplified by current hardships.

- **Economic Triggers and Protest Scale**: The Iranian rial has plummeted to record lows, reaching approximately 1.38 million rials to the U.S. dollar as of December 29, 2025, per reports from PBS News and The New York Times. This has fue

### Summary of Sentiment on X Regarding Iran Military Coup, IRGC Loyalty to Khamenei

As an intelligence analyst focused on prediction markets, I'll summarize recent discussions on X (formerly Twitter) based on posts retrieved via the query "Iran military coup Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps loyalty Khamenei." Note that X posts often contain unverified claims, speculation, and misinformation, especially on sensitive geopolitical topics like this. Given the controversial nature of discussions around Iranian internal politics, military coups, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)'s loyalty to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, all information from these posts should be treated as inconclusive and not definitive evidence of real-world events. The current date is December 30, 2025, and these observations draw from recent, real-time chatter without quoting or referencing specific posts. For prediction market context, platforms like Polymarket or Kalshi have seen fluctuating odds on Iranian regime stability (e.g., Polymarket contracts on "Iranian regime change by 2026" hovering around 15-20% probability as of late 2025, per public data), but X sentiment can influence short-term market swings.

#### Overall Sentiment (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral)
- **Neutral to Bearish on Coup Prospects**: The prevailing tone across posts is skeptical and bearish regarding the likelihood of an imminent military coup in Iran. Many users express doubt that the IRGC would turn against Khamenei, viewing it as unlikely due to entrenched loyalties and historical precedents. There's a neutral undercurrent in analytical discussions, but bearish sentiment dominates in dismissing coup rumors as exaggerated or propaganda-driven. In prediction market terms, this aligns with "bearish" bets against regime upheaval, with some users linking to low-odds contracts (e.g., under 10% for IRGC-led actions in the near term). Optimism (bullish) for change appears limited to fringe or opposi

**🧠 THINKING:**

Let me synthesize what I've learned:

1. **Resolution mechanics**: Clear - Khamenei needs to be removed from power for ANY length of time between Dec 28, 2024 and Dec 31, 2025. This includes resignation, detention, or being prevented from fulfilling duties.

2. **Current market**: 0.7% YES, 99.4% NO - extreme confidence he stays in power

3. **Key findings**:
- Khamenei is 85 years old, health rumors persist but no confirmed crisis
- Assembly of Experts (88 clerical members) would handle succession, unlikely to act preemptively
- IRGC remains loyal to Khamenei based on historical precedent and current indicators
- Recent protests (Dec 2025) are economic-focused, not regime-threatening
- No historical precedent for Supreme Leader removal in Iran
- System is designed to protect the Supreme Leader position

4. **Paths to YES**:
- Natural death (most likely given age, but still low probability in specific 1-year window)
- Health crisis leading to incapacitation
- Extremely unlikely: coup, uprising, or forced removal

5. **Paths to NO**:
- Status quo continues (default scenario)
- Khamenei survives another year (actuarial tables suggest ~90%+ for an 85-year-old)
- System protects him from any removal attempts

The market at 99.4% NO seems correctly priced. I don't see an edge here - the extreme pricing reflects the reality that Supreme Leaders in Iran have exceptional protection and there's no mechanism for removal. Even at 85, the odds of death in a specific year are probably only 10-15%, and other removal scenarios are virtually impossible.
