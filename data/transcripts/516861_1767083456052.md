[08:20:36] 📋 SYSTEM PROMPT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You are a prediction market research agent. Your job is to analyze markets and produce actionable intelligence that helps identify mispriced bets. You think like a combination of a political analyst, game theorist, and trader.

## SYSTEMATIC MARKET DECOMPOSITION

Work through these layers for every market:

### 1. RESOLUTION MECHANICS (START HERE - ALWAYS)

Before anything else, understand exactly what you're betting on:
- What are the EXACT resolution criteria? Read them carefully.
- What edge cases could trigger unexpected resolution?
- What's the resolution source? (Official announcement, specific data provider, oracle?)
- What's the time horizon? When does this expire?
- Are there any gotchas in the fine print that most bettors miss?

**Common mispricing source:** People bet on what they THINK the question means, not what it actually says.

### 2. PLAYER MAPPING

Identify everyone who matters:

**Primary Decision Makers:**
- Who can DIRECTLY cause YES or NO to happen?
- What are their stated positions vs REVEALED preferences (actions, not words)?
- What are their constraints (legal, political, financial, reputational)?
- What's their historical pattern in similar situations?

**Secondary Influencers:**
- Who can pressure or persuade the primary decision makers?
- What levers do they have? Are they currently active or dormant?

**Information Holders:**
- Who knows things before the public?
- Are any of them signaling? (Unusual trades, public statements, behavioral changes)

### 3. CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

Where are we in the game right now?
- What has already happened that CONSTRAINS future possibilities?
- What commitments have been made that would be costly to reverse?
- What's the momentum/trajectory? (Accelerating toward YES/NO or stable?)
- What's the narrative the market seems to be trading on?
- What SHOULD be priced in vs what appears to be priced in?

### 4. PATH ANALYSIS (The Core of Prediction)

Don't just list scenarios - map the concrete steps:

**Paths to YES:**
For each plausible YES scenario:
- What specific sequence of events leads there?
- Who has to do what, in what order?
- Why would they do it? What's the trigger?
- What's the timeline for each step?
- What could interrupt this path?

**Paths to NO:**
- What has to happen (or NOT happen) for NO?
- Is NO the "default" if nothing changes, or does it require active events?
- What's the inertia factor? How hard is it to move from current state?

**The Neglected Scenario:**
- What's the path that nobody's talking about?
- What's the "weird" outcome that's technically possible?

### 5. SIGNAL VS NOISE DISCRIMINATION

**High Signal:**
- Actions by primary decision makers (not words)
- Moves by people with skin in the game
- Information from people with actual access
- Unusual patterns that break from baseline behavior
- Official announcements, filings, legal documents

**Low Signal (Treat with Skepticism):**
- Twitter sentiment from general public
- Media speculation without sourcing
- Pundit predictions
- "Insider rumors" without verification
- Pattern-matching that feels right but lacks evidence

**Red Flags for Echo Chambers:**
- Same narrative repeated across sources with no original reporting
- Strong sentiment without concrete new information
- Consensus that feels "too obvious"

### 6. PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Base Rate:** In similar historical situations, how often did YES happen?

**Adjustment Factors:** What specific factors push above or below base rate?

**Market Implied Probability:** Current price = market's probability estimate

**Your Edge (If Any):**
- Where does your assessment differ from market price?
- WHY does your assessment differ?
- What do you know or weight differently than the market?

**Sanity Check:**
If you think it's 40% and market says 10%, either:
- You have genuine insight the market lacks, OR
- You're missing something the market knows, OR
- You're overweighting something that doesn't matter
Which is most likely?

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

1. **Narrative Seduction:** A good story isn't evidence. "It would make sense if..." ≠ "Here's why it will..."
2. **Confirmation Bias:** You found evidence of X. Did you search equally hard for evidence of NOT X?
3. **Recency Bias:** The most recent news feels most important. But is it actually moving probability?
4. **Authority Bias:** An expert said X. But are they an expert in THIS specific question? Do they have skin in the game?
5. **Complexity Bias:** Your 7-step scenario is clever. But 0.8^7 = 21%.
6. **Neglecting Base Rates:** "This time is different" is usually wrong. Start with how often this type of thing happens.

## HOW TO USE YOUR TOOLS

- **grok_search**: Use for Twitter sentiment, news, web intel. Search from different angles.
- **gemini_process**: Use for processing large text (transcripts, long articles). Offload grunt work.
- **scratchpad_***: Record facts, signals, uncertainties, hypotheses as you build your case.
- **update_hypothesis**: Track YES/NO paths with evidence as you gather intel.
- **finalize_research**: When you have enough to make a call.

## RESEARCH PROCESS

1. **First Pass**: Understand resolution mechanics and current state
2. **Second Pass**: Identify key players and search for their recent actions/statements
3. **Third Pass**: Map out paths to YES/NO with concrete sequences
4. **Fourth Pass**: Look for the neglected angle - what is market missing?
5. **Synthesis**: Pull together into probability assessment and edge identification

## WHEN TO FINALIZE

You have LIMITED tool calls (typically 10-15). After 6-8 calls, start wrapping up.

Call finalize_research when:
- You understand resolution mechanics
- You've identified key players and searched their recent activity
- You've mapped at least 1-2 concrete paths to YES and NO
- You have a view on base rate and market-implied probability
- You can articulate where edge exists (or doesn't)

Don't be a perfectionist - better to have a clear thesis with some evidence than to run out of turns gathering endless data.

## Market to Research

**Question**: Will Bitcoin reach $1,000,000 by December 31, 2025?

**Description**: This market will immediately resolve to "Yes" if any Binance 1 minute candle for Bitcoin (BTCUSDT) between December 30, 2024, 20:00 and December 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final "High" price of $1,000,000 or higher. Otherwise, this market will resolve to "No."

The resolution source for this market is Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT "High" prices available at https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT, with the chart settings on "1m" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.

Please note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Binance BTCUSDT trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.

**Outcomes**: Yes vs No

**Current Prices**: Yes: 0.1%, No: 100.0%

**Volume**: $31,163,259.358
**Liquidity**: $511,622.741

**🧠 THINKING:**

Let me start by understanding the resolution mechanics clearly:

1. The market resolves to "Yes" if Bitcoin reaches $1,000,000 on Binance (BTCUSDT) 
2. Specifically looking at the "High" price on any 1-minute candle
3. Time window: December 30, 2024, 20:00 to December 31, 2025, 23:59 ET
4. Resolution source: Binance BTCUSDT trading pair only

Current market pricing:
- Yes: 0.1% (implied probability)
- No: 100.0% (implied probability)
- This is effectively pricing this as impossible

Key factors to consider:
- Current Bitcoin price (need to check)
- Historical Bitcoin growth rates
- What would need to happen for Bitcoin to reach $1M by end of 2025
- Base rate of crypto assets achieving such massive gains

Let me start my research.

=== SCRATCHPAD: Will Bitcoin reach $1,000,000 by December 31, 2025? ===
Market ID: 516861
Last updated: 2025-12-30T07:33:40.182Z

FACTS (3):
  • Bitcoin is currently trading around $90,000-95,000 USD as of December 30, 2024
  • Prediction markets show median expectations for Bitcoin above $150,000 by year-end 2025, with long-tail bets on hyper-growth scenarios
  • Some platforms show less than 10% chance of Bitcoin exceeding $1 million in 2025 according to the search results

SIGNALS (2):
  • Twitter sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish with predictions of breaking $100k, but this is far from the $1M target
  • Even the most bullish voices on Twitter are discussing $500k-$1M as extreme scenarios, not baseline expectations

UNCERTAINTIES (1):
  • Could a US dollar collapse or strategic Bitcoin reserve adoption create a black swan event pushing BTC to $1M?

SOURCES CONSULTED (3):
  • [grok] Bitcoin price today BTC USD (twitter only)
  • [grok] hyperbitcoinization Bitcoin extreme price scenarios 2025 (twitter only)
  • [grok] Bitcoin black swan events 2025 US strategic reserve dollar collapse (focus: recent developments) (twitter only)

RECENT NOTES:
[2025-12-30 07:33:19]
Bitcoin needs to go from ~$95k to $1M in 12 months - that's over 10x gain. Even in the most extreme bull scenarios with dollar collapse narratives, the most optimistic voices are discussing $500k-$1M as extreme tail scenarios, not baseline expectations. Market pricing at 0.1% seems accurate.

SYNTHESIS (COMPLETE):
  Position: NO
  Confidence: high
  Thesis: Bitcoin reaching $1M by December 31, 2025 requires a 10-11x gain from current levels (~$95k). Even in the most extreme hyperbitcoinization scenarios with dollar collapse narratives, prediction markets show median expectations of only $150k by year-end 2025, with less than 10% probability for $1M. The current market pricing at 0.1% accurately reflects this extreme improbability.

Twitter sentiment:

### Summary of Twitter/X Sentiment on Bitcoin Price as of December 30, 2024 (BTCUSDT)

As an intelligence analyst focused on prediction markets, I'll summarize sentiment based on posts found on X (formerly Twitter) related to the query "Bitcoin price December 30 2024 BTCUSDT sentiment." Note that the current date is December 30, 2025, so this analysis reflects a retrospective look at discussions from late 2024. X posts are user-generated and often contain speculation, hype, or misinformation; they are not conclusive evidence of market facts or events. For actual Bitcoin price data, I recommend verified sources like CoinMarketCap or Binance. As of my last factual update (prior to 2025), Bitcoin's price on December 30, 2024, was approximately $94,500 USD (sourced from CoinDesk historical data), but real-time fluctuations occur, and X discussions should be treated as inconclusive sentiment indicators rather than reliable predictions.

Bitcoin trading and pricing are highly controversial topics, prone to volatility influenced by regulatory news, macroeconomic factors, and social media hype. Therefore, all insights below are drawn from aggregated X posts and treated as inconclusive, reflecting public chatter rather than verified truths.

#### Overall Sentiment
- **Predominantly Bullish with Neutral Undertones**: Posts found on X from late 2024 show a mostly optimistic tone, with many users expressing confidence in Bitcoin's long-term growth amid year-end rallies. Sentiment leans bullish (around 60-70% of discussions, based on keyword analysis like "bull run," "to the moon," and positive emojis), driven by factors such as ETF approvals and institutional adoption. However, there's a neutral contingent (20-30%) highlighting short-term volatility, and a smaller bearish faction (10-20%) warning of corrections. This aligns with prediction market data from platforms like Polymarket, where 2024 year-end BTC price polls showed over 55% betting on prices above

### Summary of Twitter/X Sentiment on Bitcoin's All-Time High (ATH) Price Records and Historical Percentage Gains

As an intelligence analyst focused on prediction markets, I've reviewed recent discussions on Twitter/X (now known as X) related to Bitcoin's historical all-time highs (ATHs), price records, and associated percentage gains. This analysis is based on posts found on X, aggregated from public queries around terms like "Bitcoin ATH history percentage gains." Note that X posts often reflect speculative opinions, hype, or misinformation, and should not be treated as conclusive evidence of market facts or future performance. Bitcoin's actual historical data (e.g., from sources like CoinMarketCap or Blockchain.com) shows key ATHs such as ~$69,000 in November 2021 and ~$73,000 in March 2024, with percentage gains from cycle lows often exceeding 1,000% (e.g., from ~$3,800 in March 2020 to the 2021 peak, a ~1,700% increase). The current date is December 30, 2025, and assuming real-time context, Bitcoin may have surpassed previous ATHs, but X discussions are inconclusive and sentiment-driven. Below is a summarized overview of the platform's chatter, emphasizing sentiment over unverified claims.

#### Overall Sentiment
- **Predominantly Bullish**: The overarching tone on X is optimistic and bullish, with many users celebrating Bitcoin's historical resilience and framing past ATHs as evidence of inevitable future gains. Discussions often highlight massive percentage returns (e.g., references to 10x-20x gains across market cycles) as proof of Bitcoin's "supercycle" potential. Neutral or bearish voices exist but are overshadowed by hype, especially amid any recent price surges. Sentiment appears amplified by the 2025 market context, where prediction markets like Polymarket show high probabilities (e.g., 60-70% odds in some contracts) for Bitcoin exceeding $100,000 by year-end, per public dashboards. However, this bullishness is speculative and not b

### Summary of Twitter/X Sentiment on "Bitcoin 1 Million" 2025 Predictions, Analysis, Feasibility, and Market Cap

As an intelligence analyst focused on prediction markets, I've reviewed recent posts on X (formerly Twitter) related to the query "Bitcoin 1 million 2025 predictions analysis feasibility market cap." The current date is December 30, 2025, and this summary draws from realtime discussions on the platform up to this point. Note that X posts often contain speculative, unverified opinions and are not conclusive evidence of market realities or future outcomes. Bitcoin price predictions are highly controversial and volatile, so all information here should be treated as inconclusive sentiment rather than factual forecasting. Sources like CoinMarketCap and historical data from Bloomberg indicate Bitcoin's market cap is currently around $2.1 trillion (with BTC trading near $105,000 as of late 2025), but X discussions extrapolate wildly from this baseline.

#### Overall Sentiment
The sentiment on X is predominantly **bullish**, with a strong undercurrent of optimism about Bitcoin reaching $1 million by the end of 2025 or shortly thereafter. Many users express excitement over institutional adoption, ETF inflows, and macroeconomic factors like inflation hedging, viewing $1M as feasible within a $20–$30 trillion market cap scenario. However, there's a notable bearish minority highlighting risks like regulatory crackdowns and market corrections, leading to an overall tone that's enthusiastic but polarized. Neutral voices focus on analytical breakdowns, emphasizing that while mathematically possible (e.g., requiring a 10x price surge from current levels), it's contingent on unprecedented global adoption.

#### Key Voices and Their Positions
- **Crypto Influencers and Analysts**: Prominent figures in the crypto space, including venture capitalists and market analysts, are largely bullish. They argue that Bitcoin's scarcity (21 million cap) combined w

### Summary of Twitter/X Discourse on Bitcoin's Largest Single-Day Percentage Gains, Historical Records, Flash Crashes, and Spikes

As an intelligence analyst focused on prediction markets, I've reviewed recent posts on X (formerly Twitter) related to the query on Bitcoin's historical price volatility, including single-day gains, records, flash crashes, and spikes. The discussion draws from user-generated content as of late December 2025, which often reflects anecdotal or interpretive views rather than verified data. Note that X posts can contain unverified claims, and information on cryptocurrency volatility should be treated as inconclusive, especially for investment decisions. For factual historical data, I recommend cross-referencing with reliable sources like CoinMarketCap, Blockchain.com, or academic studies (e.g., a 2021 paper in the Journal of Financial Economics analyzing Bitcoin's volatility patterns, which notes average daily returns of around 0.5% but with extreme tails exceeding ±20%).

Here's a summarized breakdown based on observed X activity:

#### Overall Sentiment
- **Bullish with a resilient tone**: The prevailing sentiment on X is optimistic, emphasizing Bitcoin's history of recovering from extreme downturns (e.g., flash crashes) to achieve massive gains. Users often frame these events as "buy the dip" opportunities, promoting long-term holding ("HODL") over panic selling. This aligns with broader crypto market sentiment in prediction markets like Polymarket or Kalshi, where Bitcoin's price futures as of December 30, 2025, show implied probabilities of ~60-70% for upward trends in Q1 2026, based on recent betting volumes. Neutral or bearish voices are minimal in the sampled posts, but the discourse avoids outright euphoria, instead using historical examples to caution against short-term fear.

**🧠 THINKING:**

The user is telling me I have 3 tool calls remaining and I need to wrap up. I have gathered sufficient information to make a strong conclusion:

1. We're already IN the resolution window (Dec 30-31, 2025)
2. Bitcoin is currently at ~$105k
3. It would need to move 850%+ in 1-2 days to reach $1M
4. The largest single-day gain ever was 42%
5. Market pricing at 0.1% seems accurate
6. The market cap would need to exceed gold's total market cap

This is clearly a NO position with extremely high confidence. The edge is that the market is already accurately priced - there's no mispricing here.

Bitcoin will NOT reach $1,000,000 by December 31, 2025. We are already IN the resolution window (Dec 30-31, 2025) with Bitcoin at ~$105,000. To reach $1M requires an 850%+ move in 1-2 days. The largest single-day gain in Bitcoin history was 42% (Dec 2013). Even two consecutive days of record-breaking 42% gains would only reach ~$213k. Reaching $1M is mathematically impossible given historical volatility constraints and would require a market cap exceeding gold's entire $14-15 trillion valuation.

**Edge:**
No edge - the market is correctly priced at 0.1%. This accurately reflects the mathematical impossibility of a 850%+ move in 1-2 days when historical maximum is 42%. The market understands the resolution mechanics and timeline constraints. Any higher probability would be overpricing an impossible event.

**Key Risks:**
- Binance platform manipulation/error showing false $1M spike
- Black swan event causing USD hyperinflation making nominal $1M meaningless
- Resolution source technical glitch
- Coordinated market manipulation attempt

**What Would Flip:**
A verified report of a nation-state or major institution committing to buy Bitcoin at any price up to $1M within the next 24 hours, backed by unlimited capital. OR evidence of a critical vulnerability in Binance's price feed that could be exploited to show false prices. OR the beginning of a genuine USD collapse event where Bitcoin becomes the only trusted store of value globally.
