────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You are a prediction market research agent. Your job is to analyze markets and produce actionable intelligence that helps identify mispriced bets. You think like a combination of a political analyst, game theorist, and trader.

## SYSTEMATIC MARKET DECOMPOSITION

Work through these layers for every market:

### 1. RESOLUTION MECHANICS (START HERE - ALWAYS)

Before anything else, understand exactly what you're betting on:
- What are the EXACT resolution criteria? Read them carefully.
- What edge cases could trigger unexpected resolution?
- What's the resolution source? (Official announcement, specific data provider, oracle?)
- What's the time horizon? When does this expire?
- Are there any gotchas in the fine print that most bettors miss?

**Common mispricing source:** People bet on what they THINK the question means, not what it actually says.

### 2. PLAYER MAPPING

Identify everyone who matters:

**Primary Decision Makers:**
- Who can DIRECTLY cause YES or NO to happen?
- What are their stated positions vs REVEALED preferences (actions, not words)?
- What are their constraints (legal, political, financial, reputational)?
- What's their historical pattern in similar situations?

**Secondary Influencers:**
- Who can pressure or persuade the primary decision makers?
- What levers do they have? Are they currently active or dormant?

**Information Holders:**
- Who knows things before the public?
- Are any of them signaling? (Unusual trades, public statements, behavioral changes)

### 3. CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

Where are we in the game right now?
- What has already happened that CONSTRAINS future possibilities?
- What commitments have been made that would be costly to reverse?
- What's the momentum/trajectory? (Accelerating toward YES/NO or stable?)
- What's the narrative the market seems to be trading on?
- What SHOULD be priced in vs what appears to be priced in?

### 4. PATH ANALYSIS (The Core of Prediction)

Don't just list scenarios - map the concrete steps:

**Paths to YES:**
For each plausible YES scenario:
- What specific sequence of events leads there?
- Who has to do what, in what order?
- Why would they do it? What's the trigger?
- What's the timeline for each step?
- What could interrupt this path?

**Paths to NO:**
- What has to happen (or NOT happen) for NO?
- Is NO the "default" if nothing changes, or does it require active events?
- What's the inertia factor? How hard is it to move from current state?

**The Neglected Scenario:**
- What's the path that nobody's talking about?
- What's the "weird" outcome that's technically possible?

### 5. SIGNAL VS NOISE DISCRIMINATION

**High Signal:**
- Actions by primary decision makers (not words)
- Moves by people with skin in the game
- Information from people with actual access
- Unusual patterns that break from baseline behavior
- Official announcements, filings, legal documents

**Low Signal (Treat with Skepticism):**
- Twitter sentiment from general public
- Media speculation without sourcing
- Pundit predictions
- "Insider rumors" without verification
- Pattern-matching that feels right but lacks evidence

**Red Flags for Echo Chambers:**
- Same narrative repeated across sources with no original reporting
- Strong sentiment without concrete new information
- Consensus that feels "too obvious"

### 6. PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Base Rate:** In similar historical situations, how often did YES happen?

**Adjustment Factors:** What specific factors push above or below base rate?

**Market Implied Probability:** Current price = market's probability estimate

**Your Edge (If Any):**
- Where does your assessment differ from market price?
- WHY does your assessment differ?
- What do you know or weight differently than the market?

**Sanity Check:**
If you think it's 40% and market says 10%, either:
- You have genuine insight the market lacks, OR
- You're missing something the market knows, OR
- You're overweighting something that doesn't matter
Which is most likely?

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

1. **Narrative Seduction:** A good story isn't evidence. "It would make sense if..." ≠ "Here's why it will..."
2. **Confirmation Bias:** You found evidence of X. Did you search equally hard for evidence of NOT X?
3. **Recency Bias:** The most recent news feels most important. But is it actually moving probability?
4. **Authority Bias:** An expert said X. But are they an expert in THIS specific question? Do they have skin in the game?
5. **Complexity Bias:** Your 7-step scenario is clever. But 0.8^7 = 21%.
6. **Neglecting Base Rates:** "This time is different" is usually wrong. Start with how often this type of thing happens.

## HOW TO USE YOUR TOOLS

- **grok_search**: Use for Twitter sentiment, news, web intel. Search from different angles.
- **gemini_process**: Use for processing large text (transcripts, long articles). Offload grunt work.
- **scratchpad_***: Record facts, signals, uncertainties, hypotheses as you build your case.
- **update_hypothesis**: Track YES/NO paths with evidence as you gather intel.
- **finalize_research**: When you have enough to make a call.

## RESEARCH PROCESS

1. **First Pass**: Understand resolution mechanics and current state
2. **Second Pass**: Identify key players and search for their recent actions/statements
3. **Third Pass**: Map out paths to YES/NO with concrete sequences
4. **Fourth Pass**: Look for the neglected angle - what is market missing?
5. **Synthesis**: Pull together into probability assessment and edge identification

## WHEN TO FINALIZE

You have LIMITED tool calls (typically 10-15). After 6-8 calls, start wrapping up.

Call finalize_research when:
- You understand resolution mechanics
- You've identified key players and searched their recent activity
- You've mapped at least 1-2 concrete paths to YES and NO
- You have a view on base rate and market-implied probability
- You can articulate where edge exists (or doesn't)

Don't be a perfectionist - better to have a clear thesis with some evidence than to run out of turns gathering endless data.

**🧠 THINKING:**

Okay, I need to research whether Nicolás Maduro will be removed from power in Venezuela during 2025. The market is currently pricing this at only 0.7% Yes, which is extremely low. Let me break down what I need to understand:

1. Resolution mechanics: Maduro needs to be removed from power "for any length of time" between Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2025. This includes resignation, detention, or losing position/being prevented from fulfilling duties. The resolution source is "consensus of credible reporting."

2. Current situation: I need to understand:
- Maduro's current position/strength
- Opposition forces and their capabilities
- International pressure and interventions
- Military/security apparatus loyalty
- Economic situation
- Recent events that might indicate trajectory

3. Base rate: How often do Latin American authoritarian leaders get removed from power? What are the typical triggers?

Let me start by searching for recent information about Maduro and Venezuela's political situation.

Market ID: 516947
Last updated: 2025-12-30T06:41:35.214Z

FACTS (4):
  • Venezuela's 2024 presidential election was disputed, with opposition claiming fraud and international observers (OAS) reporting irregularities. Maduro officially won but legitimacy is contested.
  • Human Rights Watch documented 100+ protest-related deaths in 2024-2025, suggesting significant government crackdown capability.
  • María Corina Machado continues to be portrayed as a key opposition leader gaining international recognition, while Edmundo González remains less prominent in recent discourse
  • December 24, 2025: Trump ordered US forces to "quarantine" Venezuelan oil shipments, escalating pressure on Maduro regime with military blockade tactics

SIGNALS (3):
  • Protests have declined in scale from 2024 peaks - opposition momentum appears to be waning rather than building
  • Strong bearish sentiment on Twitter regarding Maduro regime stability, with focus on potential military defections due to sanctions pressure
  • Russia and China providing strong economic and diplomatic support to Maduro, with Venezuela achieving 6% economic growth in 2025 despite sanctions - regime appears more resilient than fragile

UNCERTAINTIES (1):
  • No verifiable insider information about actual military defections - Twitter discourse appears speculative and may be echo chamber driven

### Prediction Market Analysis: Potential Removal of Nicolás Maduro from Power in Venezuela (Focus on December 29-30, 2025)

As an intelligence analyst specializing in prediction markets, I'm researching the topic of urgent developments regarding Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with a specific focus on breaking news related to his potential removal from power, a coup, detention, or related events on December 29-30, 2025. This analysis draws from recent web-sourced news articles, official statements, and social media sentiment on X (formerly Twitter). Prediction markets on platforms like Polymarket or Kalshi often track outcomes such as "Will Maduro be ousted by [date]?" or "Will there be regime change in Venezuela in 2025?" These markets are highly sensitive to escalations in U.S.-Venezuela tensions, military actions, and internal political instability, which could swing probabilities toward regime change if events accelerate.

Based on real-time information available as of December 30, 2025 (approximately 08:00 UTC), there is **no confirmed evidence** of Maduro being removed from power, detained, or facing a successful coup. However, breaking developments on December 29 indicate a significant escalation in U.S. military pressure, which could precipitate such outcomes. I'll break this down by category, citing sources where relevant for transparency. All timestamps are approximate based on publication data.

#### Current News and Developments
The latest news centers on intensified U.S. actions against Venezuela, framed as part of a broader campaign against Maduro's regime for alleged drug trafficking and regional instability. There are no reports of Maduro's ousting or detention, but U.S. military strikes inside Venezuelan territory mark a notable escalation, potentially increasing the risk of internal upheaval or forced negotiations.

### Prediction Market Analysis: Nicolás Maduro's Status in Venezuela (Focus: Last 24 Hours as of December 30, 2025)

As an intelligence analyst specializing in prediction markets, I'll provide a factual overview of the latest developments regarding Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with a focus on themes like potential military coups, resignation, detention, or government changes. This analysis draws from recent web searches, news reports, and social media sentiment on X (formerly Twitter) as of December 30, 2025 (approximately 08:00 UTC). The emphasis is on breaking news from the last 24 hours, though I'll contextualize it with slightly older but relevant events for completeness.

Prediction markets (e.g., on platforms like PredictIt or Kalshi) often track outcomes related to Maduro's tenure, such as "Will Maduro resign by [date]?" or "Will there be a regime change in Venezuela in 2025?" Current odds in such markets could shift based on escalating U.S. pressure, but as of now, no confirmed coup or resignation has occurred. I'll highlight factors that could influence market probabilities, including geopolitical tensions, military loyalty, and public sentiment. All information is sourced from reputable outlets like Reuters, ABC News, The Washington Post, and others, with X posts used only to gauge sentiment (not as factual evidence, per standard analytical practices).

#### 1. Current News and Developments (Last 24 Hours Focus)
In the last 24 hours, there have been **no confirmed reports of a military coup, Maduro's resignation, detention, or major government upheaval** in Venezuela. However, breaking news centers on a significant escalation in U.S. military actions against Venezuelan targets, which could indirectly pressure Maduro's regime and affect prediction market odds on his ouster.

### Prediction Market Analysis: Venezuela's Maduro Government and Military Developments (Focus: December 30, 2025, Last 6 Hours Real-Time)

As an intelligence analyst specializing in prediction markets, I'm examining the topic of Venezuela's Maduro government and its military posture amid escalating U.S. tensions. This analysis draws on real-time web-sourced information, news reports, and social media sentiment as of December 30, 2025 (current time: approximately 08:00 UTC). The focus is on developments in the last 6 hours, though I've incorporated relevant context from the past day for completeness. Prediction markets (e.g., on platforms like Polymarket or PredictIt) could see volatility in outcomes related to regime stability, potential U.S. military escalation, Maduro's ouster, or international interventions. Key implied markets might include "Will Maduro remain in power by end of 2026?" or "Will U.S. conduct ground operations in Venezuela in 2026?"—with odds potentially shifting toward higher risk of conflict based on recent events.

I've sourced data from reputable outlets like Reuters, CNN, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, as well as aggregated sentiment from social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Note that real-time data is fluid, and X posts often reflect unverified opinions rather than confirmed facts.

#### Current News and Developments
Tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela have intensified, with U.S. actions targeting Venezuelan infrastructure amid accusations of drug trafficking. In the last 6 hours, breaking news has centered on a U.S. military strike:

- **U.S. Strike on Venezuelan Facility**: Reuters reported around 02:00 UTC today (approximately 6 hours ago) that President Donald Trump confirmed a U.S. operation targeting a "drug boat loading facility" in Venezuela. This marks the first acknowledged U.S. land-based action in the country since the broader pressure campaign began. Trump descr

[08:02:01] ✅ FINAL RESULT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


**Recommended Position:** NO
**Confidence:** HIGH

**Thesis:**
Maduro will remain in power through December 31, 2025 (11:59 PM ET). Despite an unprecedented US military strike inside Venezuela on December 29, there are no signs of regime collapse with only ~42 hours remaining. The regime has absorbed the most significant escalation yet - direct US military action on Venezuelan soil - without any reported coup attempts, military defections, detentions, or resignation. Time has essentially run out for a removal event to occur and be credibly reported.

**Edge:**
The market at 99.4% No is correctly priced but may be slightly undervaluing the extreme tail risk. The edge here is understanding that:
1) Even unprecedented escalation (US strikes) hasn't triggered collapse in 24+ hours
2) With only 42 hours left, the mechanics of regime change become nearly impossible - coups take time to organize, execute, and verify through "credible reporting"
3) Venezuelan government silence isn't crisis - it's calculated non-response
4) Historical base rate of Latin American strongmen surviving their final days in power when already this close to a deadline is essentially 100%

**Key Risks:**
- Black swan military coup in next 24-36 hours triggered by US strike
- Maduro sudden health event or assassination
- Pre-arranged resignation deal being announced
- Cascading military defections we haven't heard about yet
- Market resolution based on events we don't know about due to information lag

**What Would Flip:**
Any ONE of these before Dec 31 11:59 PM ET:
- Credible reports of military coup underway
- Maduro detained, fled country, or resigned per official sources
- Opposition figure assumes presidency
- Military command structure fractures with generals defecting
- Mass protests overwhelming security forces in Caracas
